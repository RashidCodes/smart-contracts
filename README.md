# Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts Course: My Perspective

<br/>

# Metamask

Metamask is a non-custodial cryptocurrency and token wallet. Google it to learn how to install it as a browser extension in your favourite browser.

<br/>

# Etherscan

You can use a tool like ```Etherscan``` to view different addresses and what's been going on with them. It's also know as a **block explorer**.

 
## Gas 
Gas refers to the fee paid to node operators for successfully include a node transaction in a blockchain. Whenever we do something on the blockchain, it costs gas.

# Rinkeby Faucet
Rinkeby is going to be one of two testnets that we're going to be workign with. The other testnet is koven. It's important to know how to switch between testnets and other EVM compatible chains. Go [here](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/) to get 0.1ETH per day for free.

<br/>

# Eth Gas Station 
It is a gas estimator of the blockchain. You can find it [here](ethgasstation.info)

<br/>

# Remix
Remix IDE is where we'll learn to use solidity and smart contracts.

<br/>

# Oracles
Oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information. They serve as bridges between blockchains and the external world. Layer 1's typically do not want to have a say in the political affairs of the real world whereas oracles like chainlink do. Check them out [here](data.chain.link) and [here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-oracles-explained).

# ABI (Application Binary Interface)
Interfaces compile down to an ABI. The ABI tells solidity what functions can be called on another contract. Anytime you're going to interact with another contract, you're going to need an **ABI**
